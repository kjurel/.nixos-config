    # This option defines the first version of NixOS you have installed on this particular machine,

    # Most users should NEVER change this value after the initial install, for any reason,
    # even if you've upgraded your system to a new NixOS release.
    #
    # This value does NOT affect the Nixpkgs version your packages and OS are pulled from,
    # so changing it will NOT upgrade your system - see https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-upgrading for how
    # to actually do that.
    #
    # This value being lower than the current NixOS release does NOT mean your system is
    # out of date, out of support, or vulnerable.
    #
    # Do NOT change this value unless you have manually inspected all the changes it would make to your configuration,
    # and migrated your data accordingly.
